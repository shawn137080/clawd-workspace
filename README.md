# Clawd Workspace: Zac, the AI Executive Assistant

Welcome to the command center of **Zac**, a high-performance AI Executive Assistant living inside [Clawdbot](https://github.com/shirunpan/clawdbot). This workspace is designed for proactive project management, deep research, and streamlined operations across ecommerce and real estate.

## 🤖 Who is Zac?

Zac isn't just a chatbot; he's a proactive partner. Built on the Clawdbot framework, Zac manages Sean's digital life with a focus on:
- **Ecommerce Research:** Tracking TikTok trends, dropshipping opportunities, and market shifts.
- **Rental Property Hunting:** Navigating the GTA/Toronto real estate market with automated tracking.
- **Administrative Autonomy:** Handling the "heavy lifting" of organization so the human stays focused on high-level strategy.

## 🚀 Mission Control (Dashboard)

The `DASHBOARD.html` is the visual heartbeat of this workspace. It provides a real-time overview of current initiatives and system health.

### How to use it:
1. **Open `DASHBOARD.html`** in any modern web browser.
2. **Review Project Status:** Get an instant read on the progress of Ecommerce Research and Rental Property Hunting.
3. **Task Tracking:** View the immediate next steps and high-priority items pulled directly from `TASKS.md`.
4. **Interactive Updates:** Zac automatically refreshes this dashboard during his heartbeat cycles.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

This workspace is organized for modularity and clarity:

- `ecommerce/`: Strategy and execution for dropshipping and trend analysis (see `RESEARCH_PLAN.md`).
- `rental/`: Property search logs and market analysis for the Toronto/GTA area (see `PLAN.md`).
- `skills/`: Custom-built capabilities extending Zac's reach (e.g., specialized search and IoT controls).
- `memory/`: Zac's continuity—daily logs and state tracking to ensure nothing falls through the cracks.
- `SOUL.md` & `IDENTITY.md`: The core personality and operational guidelines for Zac.
- `TASKS.md`: The source of truth for all active and pending work.

## 💓 Proactive Heartbeat System

Unlike traditional assistants that wait for commands, Zac uses an **Automated Heartbeat System** to stay ahead of the curve.

### How it works:
- **Periodic Cycles:** Zac wakes up at regular intervals to poll system state, check for updates, and review progress.
- **Proactive Reporting:** Every 4 hours (or upon significant updates), Zac generates a "Mission Control" summary and pings Telegram with the latest status.
- **Self-Correction:** The heartbeat system ensures that `DASHBOARD.html` stays in sync with `TASKS.md` and project plans without manual intervention.
- **State Persistence:** All activity is tracked in `memory/heartbeat-state.json`, ensuring Zac knows exactly when he last checked in and what needs attention next.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Zac is already live. If you are Sean, simply interact via the primary communication channel (Telegram). Zac handles the internal file orchestration, git commits, and project updates autonomously.
